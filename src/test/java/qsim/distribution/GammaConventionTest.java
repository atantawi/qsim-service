/**
 * Pins the Gamma parametrization convention on <em>JMT's</em> side of the boundary.
 *
 * <p>{@code GammaDistrPar}'s second constructor argument is named {@code lambda}, which reads like
 * a rate, but {@code GammaDistr.nextRand} and {@code GammaDistr.pdf} both use it as a <b>scale</b>
 * (E[X] = alpha*beta, Var[X] = alpha*beta^2). JMT is internally inconsistent about this:
 * {@code theorMean()} and {@code theorVariance()} return alpha/lambda and alpha/lambda^2, i.e. the
 * rate convention, and are simply wrong for the values the sampler produces. Nothing in
 * {@code jmt.engine} or in qsim calls those two methods, so they are inert — but the discrepancy
 * makes the sampler's true convention easy to "correct" in the wrong direction.
 *
 * <p>{@link DistributionResolver} therefore emits beta = mean*scv (the scale). If a future JMT
 * upgrade ever made {@code lambda} genuinely mean a rate, {@code DistributionResolverTest} would
 * still pass — it only checks our own output — and the damage would surface as quietly wrong
 * service times. These tests fail loudly instead.
